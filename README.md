A set of 12 python projects for helping me get practice.

# 12 Python Learning Projects
The projects in this repo are based on [12 Beginner Python Projects - Coding Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg).

## Overview of Projects

The projects in this repo varies from complexity, starting very easy and becoming hard as we evolve. The main goal is just to practice python syntax.

- _madlibs_ fills a sentence with user informed words. It shows an easy way to concatenate strings. It also practices basic user input. I added a check to ensure a valid weekday.

- _user guess random number_ is a game in which you try to guess a random number. It puts together conditionals (`if/elif`) and loops (`while`), along with the `random` library. I improved the code by importing only the function we used, `randint()`.

- _computer guess random number_ is a game similar to the previous one. The difference is that, in this one, the computer should guess the number. You think on a number and give the computer a limit. It tries random numbers till the limit you gave. Every time the computer guesses, you give it a hint whether it is too low or high. Eventually, the computer will get it right.
